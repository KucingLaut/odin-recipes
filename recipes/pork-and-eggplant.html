    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is one of my go-to recipes if I wanted a pork stir fry with some veggies. It's spicy and savory, complementing the meaty and oily pork and soft but satisfying eggplant. It's pretty easy and quick to make.</p>
    <p>While it's simple, you can elevate this dish by adding more ingredients like green onion, bell peper, and much more veggies. If you can't really stand the heat, you can omit the chilli flakes.</p>
